// ITCSS standard pyramid implementation sample
// According to ITCSS, all files should reside in one folder
// and we should sufix the filenames with the layer appropiated layer

// 1rs Layer -> Settings
// These are preprocessor variables for later use.
@import "colors.settings";

// 2d Layer -> Tools
// These include all the mixins and functions.
@import "mixins.tools";


// 3thrd Layer -> Generic
// This includes all the third-party CSS used throughout the site.
// Bootstrap? Foundation? normalize?
@import "normalize.generic";

// 4th Layer -> Base
// These are element styles — no classes or IDs.
// Base typography styles go here, as well as anything needed to style raw elements.
// styles for transverse elements like h1, h2 ..., lists, etc.
@import "titles.base";


// 5th -> Objects
// This layer is mostly layout-driven, and doesn’t include anything cosmetic (backgrounds, colors etc..)
//@import "mycomponent.object";

// 6th -> Components
// a cosmetic layer — this is where we should include more specific styling instructions for objects.
// Without the components layer, the site would still have its structure, but would look like a gray-box wireframe.
//@import "mycomponent.component";

// trumps here
// u sure u need this?
