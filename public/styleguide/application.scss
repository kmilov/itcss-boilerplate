// ITCSS standard pyramid implementation sample
// According to ITCSS, all files should reside in one folder
// in this case, we split every layer in different folders.
// but, we added created the file names with the appropiated layer


// Settings
//
// Layer to set preprocessor variables for later use, include colors and fonts
//
// Styleguide 1.0
@import "settings/colors.settings";
@import "settings/fonts.settings";
@import "settings/icons.settings";

// Mixins
//
// Layer to create the different mixins for later use.
//
// Styleguide 2.0
@import "mixins/mixins.tools";


// Generics
//
// This includes all the third-party CSS used throughout the site.
// like normalize, grid system, bootstrap
//
// Styleguide 3.0
@import "generics/normalize.generic";


// Base
//
// These are element styles — no classes or IDs.
// Base typography styles go here, as well as anything needed to style raw elements.
// styles for transverse elements like h1, h2 ..., lists, etc.
//
// Styleguide 4.0
@import "base/headings.base";


// Objects
//
// This layer is mostly layout-driven, and doesn’t include anything cosmetic (backgrounds, colors etc..)
// this is not used for this example, since the components will include everything from markup to styles
//
// Styleguide 5.0
// @import "objects/btn.object";

// Components
//
// a cosmetic layer — this is where we should include more specific styling instructions for objects.
// Without the components layer, the site would still have its structure, but would look like a gray-box wireframe.
//
// Styleguide 5.0
@import "components/btn.component";
@import "components/forms.component";

// trumps here
// u sure u need this?
